## Food Truck Project
Imagine for a moment, a sunny Friday afternoon. You are hankering for street tacos on your lunch and it occurs to you... FOOD TRUCK FRIDAY! That's right. The commercial complex you work for is blessed with the presence of many aspiring master chefs. All looking for your lunch money. But wait, which one did you eat at last week? Was it better than the week before?

This program allows a user to review up to five food trucks. Perfect for that Friday afternoon. In this version, version 1.0 currently in testing, you (the user) can input information for your delicious experience and see which food truck was rated best. Save your lunch money. Don't repeatedly spend at the same woeful food truck because you have no memory for these things.


## What I learned
This exercise really drove home using classes as blueprints for building. It also helped me to practice and work through errors in calling methods properly and I struggled with syntax and properly using an array.

Due to the directions of the assignment, it struck the fear of god in me when using the word "static." I'm still concerned I somehow incorrectly used static and failed my project. Sending up prayers that I read this right.

I learned so much about object oriented programming and even experienced my own little mini weekend rollercoaster of emotion.

The line "The truck id is not input by the user, but instead assigned automatically in the FoodTruck constructor from a static field that is incremented as each truck is created" caused me to turn to the internet, and I learned a lot about what can happen inside a blueprint(class) and how dynamic that could become.

## Technologies used
I wrote this program in Eclipse and used Atom for this README. For the first time I learned something from StackOverflow.

## For the Teaching Assistants and instructors
You are gems. Saturday was infinitely helpful to me. This project was challenging and very helpful in helping me look back at the weeks lesson and experiencing many lightbulbs. I give it a 5 out of 5.
